the mosquito

lurking from within a crowd,
hiding behind an excuse
of innocence of a normal being,
by putting on a plastic eye.
but cunningly patient for an opening
on my skin,
which i perhaps exposed
because oh it's summer. 
and its hot.
Also the irony of its precence 
- oh its summer.
It is an intelligent creature.
It can smell the aura of a skin,
it's eyes not just limited to sight
but to warmth and co2 emited
know where the cloth starts 
and where it ends.
It can see through the
fibers of my cloth,
the shape of my body 
,the precense of blood
like a surveillance drone
waiting to strike.
These things are mainly visible at night -
when its dark or when secluded,
generally when no guts are required.
It is that man
standing besides my seat.
