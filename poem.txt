the mosquito

lurking from within a crowd,
hiding behind an excuse
of innocence of a normal being,
by putting on a plastic eye.
but cunningly patient for an opening
on my skin,
which i perhaps exposed
because oh it's summer 
and its hot.
Also the irony of its precence 
- oh its summer.
It is an intelligent creature.
It can smell the aura of a skin,
know where the cloth starts 
and where it ends.
It can see through the
fibers of my cloth,
the shape of my body 
,the precense of blood
like a surveillance drone
waiting to strike.
It is that man
stading besides my seat.
